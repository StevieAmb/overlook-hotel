### _Overview_
This application is a solo project where I created a site where a user could log in, see the rooms which they have already booked, along with the amount of money they have spent from booking their rooms. With my inspiration from many different hotel booking sites, one of them being Agoda, I got to mess with setting up a section over a hero. As a user/customer, once you login, you should be able to see all of the rooms you booked, search for available rooms by date, filter through the available rooms, and book a room of your choosing. 

Once you login, I both hope and promise you will enjoy your stay at OverLook Hotel.
