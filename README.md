### _Overview_
This application is a solo project where I created a site where a user could log in, see the rooms which they have already booked, along with the amount of money they have spent from booking their rooms. With my inspiration from many different hotel booking sites, one of them being Agoda, I got to mess with setting up a section over a hero. As a user/customer, once you login, you should be able to see all of the rooms you booked, search for available rooms by date, filter through the available rooms, and book a room of your choosing. 

Once you login, I both hope and promise you will enjoy your stay at OverLook Hotel.


### _Setup_
- Clone this repository down to your local machine
- Navigate into the whats-cookin-starter-kit directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- Copy http:localhost// in your browser to run live preview
- Run `open index.html` in the terminal to test application


### _Screenshots_
If you want to book a stay in the OverLook Hotel, before I walk you through the hotel, let me walk you through the site.
The first thing you're going to want to do is log-in. 

Of course, you know how to do this. 
You've been here before.

Now you remember. You can see all of the bookings you've made! I'm glad you've been enjoying your time with us

Wanna book another room? I'm sure you remember how to do that, too. Just use our trusty calendar to pick a date, and see what rooms are available!
